## A Practical IndexedDB API

A more practical alternative to [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). db64 supports [all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/indexeddb).  


### db64
- Promise based API
- Set and get single or multiple entries
- Delete single, multiple or all entries
- No versioning 
- 2.47KB minified

E.g.
```javascript
import db64 from './db64.js'

try {
  // First create a database with stores
  await db64.create('Games', ['Super Nintendo', 'Gameboy'])

  // Assing a variable for modifying a store
  const snes = db64.use('Games', 'Super Nintendo')

  // Set multiple entries into Super Nintendo
  await snes.setEntries({ adventure: 'Mario World', rpg: 'Zelda', fighting: 'Street Fighter II' })

  // Get multiple entries from Super Nintendo
  await snes.getEntries(['adventure', 'fighting']) // { adventure: 'Mario Wrold', fighting: 'Street Fighter II' }

  // Delete an existing db 
  await db64.delete('Games')
...
```

### Why IndexedDB, why not localStorage?
- Better performance
- Asynchronous (localStorage is blocking)
- Larger storage quota (localStorage is capped at 5MB)
- Reliable (no type coercion)
- Uses the [structuredClone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone) algorithm

### Practical challenges when using IndexedDB
- It's event driven, without promises
- It was designed to encourage versioning, which is not necessary for the majority of projects
- The API is considered as (low level) and can be challenging as a replacement for localStorage
- Removing databases and stores is not straight forward nor necessary, and usually requires versioning


**Install**
```
npm i db64
```
**Import**
```javascript
import db64 from 'db64.js'    // ES (native)
// or
import db64 from 'db64'       // ES
// or
const db64 = require('db64')  // CommonJS
```

**Create a database with stores**  _(string, array)_
```javascript 
await db64.create('game-consoles', ['n64', 'ps5', 'dreamcast', 'xbox-360'])
```

**Use a store**  _(string, string)_
```javascript 
const n64 = db64.use('game-consoles', 'n64')
```

**Set an entry** _(IDB type, IDB type)_ _See [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) for supported types_
```javascript
await n64.set(5, 'Super Mario 64')
```
**Set multiple entries** _(object | array)_
```javascript
await n64.setEntries({fps: 'GoldenEye 007', space: 'Star Fox 64', adventure: 'Banjo-Kazooie'})
await n64.setEntries(['Wave Race 64', 'The Legend of Zelda'])
```

**Get an entry** _(IDB type)_
```javascript
const fps = await n64.get('fps') // GoldenEye 007
```

**Get multiple entries** _(object | array)_
```javascript
const rareware = await n64.getEntries(['fps', 'adventure', 5]) // {fps: 'GoldenEye 007', adventure: 'Banjo-Kazooie', 0: 'Super Mario 64'}
```
**Delete an entry** _(IDB type | array)_
```javascript
await n64.delete(1)  // Deletes 'The Legend of Zelda'
```

**Delete multiple entries**
```javascript
await n64.delete(['adventure', 0])  // Deletes 'Banjo-Kazooie' and 'Super Mario 64'
```

**Clear a store** _(string, string)_
```javascript
await db64.clear('game-consoles', 'n64') // All data in n64 is deleted
```

**Delete a DB** _(string)_
```javascript
await db64.delete('game-consoles') // game-consoles is deleted
```

### Why db64 opts out of deleting object stores
We are avoiding versioning to keep your life simple. Deleting an existing object stores in IndexedDB triggers a version change. _(Whilst compaction may optimise, it doesn't ensure the removal of unwanted data)_

Here's the db64 workflow:

1. Initialise by creating a DB with stores or multiple DBs with stores.
    - _(You won't be able to add stores to an existing DB later, unless you delete the DB in question. This is by design)_

2. Use a DB.
    - _(You can make multiple transactions concurrently for multiple DBs, or stores)_

3. Set, get and clear data.

4. **Manage the lifecycle of DB deletion and re-creation**:
    - _When data cannot be retrieved from the user's IndexedDB_
    - _When there's an error_
      - _Data corruption_
      - _Quota exceeded_
      - _General errors_
    - _**When in the future you decide to add more stores at initialisation**_
    - _When you want to remove stores, especially for data protection_

It's important to consider step 4, if not you may leave users stuck because everything looks fine on your computer.
Step 4 isn't specific to IndexedDB, it also applies to _localStorage_ but it's more prevalent with IndexedDB as there's 
a higher risk of the application breaking if you decide to make chages to the codebase in the future.

If you do require versioning consider using [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb). **If you're not building a progressive web app (PWA) you probably don't need versioning**.

### Contributors
Don't hesitate just contribute, it's a tiny library we will figure it out.

If you want to edit `./README.md` edit `./src/_readme.md` which will update `./README.md` when `node create-distribution.js` is called.
This is to keep the minified size accurate.
